# Excaliber
This script was written to run tests via sqlmap a lot faster and accurate. 
The script runs in bash and you can easily customize the flags. 
Script works best with batch lists. 
Will implement a function to scan for Nosql, unless sqlmap updates.

# Disclaimer:
This script is for auditing web-servers at a faster rate and for educational purposes. I am not nor held responsible for the misuse of this code. Please follow the guide lines of sqlmap.
