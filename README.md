This script was written to run tests via sqlmap a lot faster and accurate. 
This is one of many projects my have coded so far. The script runs in bash and you can easily customize the flags. 
I want to be able to give this script a list of web servers to test and it will return 
me all information about each tested web server. I want to add option to save all results in readable format and with an extra 
option of a through search. These couple of scripts are part of something bigger im working on so ill appreciate any feedback 
and advice to make the code better. 




This script is for auditing web-servers at a faster rate and for educational purposes. I am not nor held responsible for the misuse of this code. Its a simple open source code.
