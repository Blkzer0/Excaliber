This script was written to run tests via sqlmap alot faster and accurate. 
This is one of many projects my have coded so far. The script runs in bash and you can easily customize the flags. 
I want to be able to give this script a list of webservers to test and it will return 
me all information about each tested webserver. I want to add option to save all results in readable format and with an extra 
option of a through search. These couple of scripts are part of something bigger im working on so ill appretiate any feedback 
and adivce to make the code better.
