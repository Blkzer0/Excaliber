This script was written to run tests via sqlmap a lot faster and accurate. 
This is one of many projects i have coded so far. The script runs in bash and you can easily customize the flags. 
I want to be able to give this script a list of web servers to test and it will return 
me all information about each tested and vulnerable web server. I want to add option to save all results in readable format and with an extra option of a through search. These couple of scripts are part of something bigger im working on so ill appreciate any feedback and advice to make the code better. I wil make a option to update this script. Look forward to many changes 




This script is for auditing web-servers at a faster rate and for educational purposes. I am not nor held responsible for the misuse of this code. Its a simple open source code.
